# Explorables

Based on the ideas presented by Brett Victor [and harvesting the links from that page]:

"An active reader asks questions, considers alternatives, questions assumptions, and even questions the trustworthiness of the author. An active reader tries to generalize specific examples, and devise specific examples for generalities. An active reader doesn't passively sponge up information, but uses the author's argument as a springboard for critical thought and deep understanding."

A bit of theory on how to achieve this is outlined in [Up and Down the Ladder of Abstraction](https://worrydream.com/LadderOfAbstraction/)
